# Big-Data-Analytics-Kimia-Farma
## SQL Queries I used in Kimia Farma Big Data Analytics Project Based Internship
During this project i was tasked to create an analysis about Kimia Farma Business Performance in 2020-2023. The requirements of the analysis are as follows:
### 1. Importing Kimia Farma Sales related dataset into Google Cloud Platform Big Query.
This was done by first downloading the dataframes from the link provided in a form of 4 CSV Files, then importing it into my Google Cloud Platform Big Query.
### 2. Creating Analysis Table
Creating Analysis Table was done by creating aggregation for certain elements in the 'Final Transaction' as facts table, as well as joining other dimension tables into 1 large table with 16 fields in total which i have copied and pasted the syntax into this repository.
In reality, i personally don't think that creating an analysis table was necessary. Given that the analysis can still be done with the help of Calculated Field feature from Looker Studio, and in any BI tools in that regard. However the ability to perform analysis with SQL would allow internship program participants to manage ad-hoc request that would definitely occur in real industry scenario.
### 3. Creating Business Performance Analytics Report using Looker Studio
Utilizing the dataset provided by Kimia Farma. participants are required to create an Analytical Dashboard with certain requirements which must be fulfilled and also freedom for insight digging that require creativity and critical thinking.
